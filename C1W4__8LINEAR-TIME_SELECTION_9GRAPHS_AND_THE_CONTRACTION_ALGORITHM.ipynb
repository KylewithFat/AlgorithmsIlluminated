    "# VIII. Linear Time Selection \n",
    "In this notebook we will look at two types of selection algorithms, the RSelect, or the randomized selection algorithm and a deterministic version called DSelect. But before we proceed the question is \"What is selection?\" A selection problem aims to find the $i^{th}$ smallest number for n given numbers. The simplest approach would be to sort the input array and then select the $i^{th}$ position number essentially doing the selection in $nlogn$ time. This however is not the optimum way as selection if an easier problem than sorting and thus we should achieve this in much less running time than sorting. To select a number from n given numbers, we will have to view all the numbers at the minimum and thus $O(n)$ is a reasonable lower bound and we know that sorting can be done in $O(nlogn)$ which is an upperbound for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do something to possibly perform the selection in $O(n)$ time? Let us implement the selection problem using the partition routine we used in quick sort."

    "From above tests, the randomized implementation works in place with constant extra memory and works on a similar way quick sort does.

Once we choose the partition routine, we know in linear time, what position the pivot element will end up in after the recursve calls. Once we know that value, we can then recurse on the left or the right split after the pivot. In the best case suppose we end up picking the median of the input array as pivot, in which case the array will be split in exactly halves. Since we always do linear work outside the recursive calls, we can express our recurrance as follows $$T(n)\\:=\\:T(\\frac{n}{2}) + O(n) $$\n",

The running time is in this case dominated by the work done outside recursive calls giving us the time as $O(n^d)$ = $O(n)$ in this case. This shows us that if we get an approximate median and split the array into two approximately equal pieces, we can expect the selection problem to run in linear time. Let us see how exactly we get linear time on an average for a given array using the following proof.\n",

    "We will track the progress of our selection problem in phases. we will call the problem is in phase j if it is operating on an array of length $(\\frac{3}{4})^{j + 1}$ to $(\\frac{3}{4})^{j}$. For example, it will be in phase 0, if the size of the array is between 0.75n to n, phase 1 of the size array is 0.56n to 0.75n and so on. The maximum value of phase j when the value of the input size will be 1 should be $log_{4/3}n$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whenever we choose an approximate median as pivot, a number that gives us 25-75% split of the input array, we are guaranteed to procees to next phase. If only when the split produces an array giving is greater than 75% of elements remaining after partition, we stay in the phase j for another recursive call. Thus we can conclude, picking an approximate median is guaranteed to take us to next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, picking an approximate median has a probability of 50%. Suppose we have n numbers say, 1 to 100, then by picking anything from 26 to 75 is an approximate median which makes up 50% of the input numbers.\n",

    "The random variable $X_j$ and $N$ are similar but the $E[X_j] \\leq E[N]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coin flopping experiment has to flip the coin atleast once to get heads. The value of X_j can be 0 if we completely skip the phase.\n",
    "We have maximum probability of 0.5 of not going out of phase j and staying in the same phase. This is similar to 0.5 probability we get tails and we we need to flip the coin another time.\n",

    "\n",
    "The only value of E(N) that satisfies the above equation is 2. The equation is explained as follows. The value 1 is for that minimum one flip needed and the value 0.5 is the probability that we get tails. We can thus say that $E(X_j) \\leq 2$\n",

This way we find the a total of $\\frac{n}{5}$ medians. We recursively keep finding the medians of medians till we hit the base case where we only one element in the input array. To illustrate this, consider we have the following input array\n",

    "Finding median of 5 numbers is a constant time activity and let that constant be c. We operate on an array of $\\frac{n}{5}$ to find medians. Thus the time taken to find the medians of medians is $\\frac{n}{5}\\cdot c$ = $O(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus find median of medians is a Linear time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median of medians is found by calling DSelect recursively on an array of size $\\frac{n}{5}$ and then the partition, which is done in linear time, determines the statistic of the pivot element (the median of medians). Based on the $i{th}$ order statistic we are interested in, we either recurse on the portion of the input to the left of the pivot or the one on the right. We therefore have two sub problems\n",

    "For this purpose we introduce the 30-70 Lemma (which we will prove later). This Lemma states that the median of medians is no less than at least 60% of elements in at least 50% of the groups of 5 and no greater than at least 60% of at least 50% of groups of 5. The value 60% of 50% is 0.6 * 0.5 = 30%. This sounds confusing, but it essentially says that there are at least 30% numbers in the input array those are smaller than the partition element (median of medians), and there are at least 30% of numbers in the input array those are larger than the partition element. The result of this is, that under no circumstance we will get the split around partition greater than 70% of original input.

    "We can therefore conclusively say that no more than 3 of 5, which is 60% of numbers including the medians in $s_1$ and $s_2$ and the minimum 2 numbers in the same batch of 5 as mom are smaller than mom.\n",
    "Similarly, we can therefore conclusively say that no more than 3 of 5, which is 60% of numbers including the medians in $l_1$ and $l_2$ and the maximum 2 numbers in the same batch of 5 as mom are larger than mom.\n",
    "Thus for this example where k = 5 (n = 25). Minimum 8 numbers are smaller than mom and minimum 8 numbers are larger than mom. The next recursive call will not have the pivot and either of these 8 numbers which makes it 9 numbers minimum. This means the maximum size of the array we can have is 16 which is 64% of input array.\n",
