    "We see above that the sorting function works well. However the efficiency of Quick sort vastly depends on how even the chosen pivot splits in input array into. Thus the choice of Pivot function is extremely crucial for the running time of the Quick sort algorithm. We know Merge sort runs in $O(nlog n)$ time and thats what we aim for. The benefit of quick sort over Merge sort is that it requires no extra memory apart from the constant memory required to store the variables. The simplest way to choose a pivot, is to always choose the first element of the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose with this approach, we end up attempting to sort an already sorted array, then by picking up the first element in the list, we do not get a left and a right split but all elements in the right (or left, depending on sorted and sorting order) split except the pivot. This will continue to happen till the entire array is sorted. This is most possible uneven split we can get in Quick sort and we will end up comparing the pivot with all remaining numbers to be sorted, this giving us a worst case time complexity of $O(n^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another extreme scenario is to implement a choose pivot function that select the median of available values in the left or right side of the array. Assuming that the operation to choose the pivot is a linear time operation (which we will see in next chapter) we can then perform the operation to find the pivot (which is a perfect median of the values we are partioning) and the partition collectively is done in linear time(with high constants, but these are suppressed in Big Oh notations).

Since we know by inductive hypothesis, p(k) holds with k < n, quick sort will correctly sort the left and right sub arrays correctly.

However, if we are ok with an approximate median, meaning, the split after partition gives us a sub array of size maximum 75% of input array (or a minimum 25% of the input array), then we can say that we would need a maximum of $log_{4/3}n$ levels till we reach the base case. In case of quick sort, the arrays are not overlapping at each level and thus the work done at each level is no more than n.
