    "# Divide and Conquer algorithms\n",
    "In this notebook we will code and analyse the following three divide and conquer algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Counting the number of inversions\n",
    "2. Matrix multiplication using Strassen's algorithm\n",
    "3. Computing the closest points together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counting Inversions\n",
    "Counting the number of inversions is a measure of how similar (or not similar) are two arrays of numbers. This algorithm is used in recommender systems where the system recommends something (say a movie) to the consumer based on how similar their rating is to other people who rated similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering is a technique where we try to find similarities between likes of people. Suppose we want to find similarities of the movie rankings of two people, we will sort movies by ranking of one person's preference and then put ranks given by the second person for those movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if your ranked 3 movies A, B and C as your favorite movies and your friend ranked their favorite movies as B A C then between you and the your friend the ranking list becomes 2 1 3 because A is your favorite movie but is second favorite for B. Similarly B is your second favorite movie but your friend's favorite. Both you and your friend's choice match for the third best movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above example we see that if two people have similar tastes, both the arrays would be identical and there would be no inversions. Higher the number of inversions more are the differences in the preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use divide and conquer algorithm like Merge sort to find the number of inversions in an array. The number of inversions in an array A are the number of pairs of indices $(i, j)$ where $i < j$ and $A[i] < A[j]$\n",
    "\n",
    "An array that is sorted has no inversions, the converse is also true, that is, an array with no inversions is sorted and is not sorted if it has atleast one inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following array\n",
    "\n",
    "1 3 5 2 4 6\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of inversions in this array are the following pair of numbers (3, 2), (5, 2) and (5, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "For an array of n numbers, we can have a maxumum of (n - 1) + (n - 2) + .. + 1 number of inversions = $n(n - 1) / 2$ number of inversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us implement counting inversion in two different ways. First one is the Bruteforce approach and the second one is using divide and conquer approach that sorts the numbers using Merge Sort along with counting the number of inversions.\n",
